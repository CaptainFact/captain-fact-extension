# How to contribute

## Prerequisites

Familiarity with [forks](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/),
[pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) and
[issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).


## Contributions types

- **Ideas**: Participate in an issue thread or start your own to have your voice heard
- **Resources**: Submit a pull request to add to RESOURCES.md with links to related content
- **Documentation**: Fix typos, clarify language, and add explanations about how things work
- **Code**: Submit new features or bug fixes, see "Code contributions" below

## Contributions: General workflow

1. [Pick or create an issue](https://github.com/CaptainFact/captain-fact-extension/issues) and tell us you're working on it
2. Fork the repo
3. Checkout `staging` branch (pull requests against `master` will not be accepted)
4. Create a new branch describing what you'll do. We encourage using `feature/your-awesome-feature` or `fix/your-fix-name` naming
5. Do your stuff and commit your changes
6. (Optional but nice) [squash your commits](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/how-to-squash-multiple-commits-into-one-with-git/13231)
7. Make a pull request of your branch against `staging` and mention the issue you're dealing with

# Communication

GitHub issues are the primary way for communicating about specific proposed
changes to this project.

[TODO] We'll soon create a place for the community to chat, maybe on Slack or on Keybase.io's
[encrypted slack alternative](https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/18/keybase-launches-fully-encrypted-slack-like-communications-tool-and-its-free/).

In both contexts, please follow the conduct guidelines below. Language issues
are often contentious and we'd like to keep discussion brief, civil and focused
on what we're actually doing, not wandering off into too much imaginary stuff.

# Conduct

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for
all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion,
or similar personal characteristic.

On IRC, please avoid using overtly sexual nicknames or other nicknames that
might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.

Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude.
Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or
implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom
a right answer, merely an optimal answer given a set of values and
circumstances.

Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you
want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.

We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone.
That is not welcome behaviour. We interpret the term "harassment" as
including the definition in the
[Citizen Code of Conduct](http://citizencodeofconduct.org/);
if you have any lack of clarity about what might be included in that concept,
please read their definition. In particular, we don't tolerate behavior that
excludes people in socially marginalized groups.

Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you feel
you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community
member, please contact one of the channel ops or any of the
[CaptainFact](https://github.com/CaptainFact) core team
immediately. Whether you're a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about
making this community a safe place for you and we've got your back.

Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing
behaviour is not welcome.
